#This script is a template for creating purchasable items in the game. 
#It is a parent class for all purchasable items and contains all the necessary methods and properties for a purchasable item.
#It inherits from the Detailable, Hostable & SuperInaugurable interfaces.
#The following are the most important properties and methods:
# - Initialize method -> initializes the item and calls the parent class's Initialize method through the super keyword
# - Host method -> runs async after the item is bought
# - OnBought method -> runs after the item is bought
# - OnGrantInterval method -> grants the player money on an interval

# - Unlock method -> unlocks the item
# - UnlockDependents method -> unlocks all dependents of the item
# - TestAndCommitPurchase method -> checks if the player has enough money along with other requirements before purchasing



# - AwaitAttemptedPurchase method -> awaits the player to enter the purchase zone
# - HideProps method -> hides the props associated with the item
# - ShowProps method -> shows the props associated with the item
# - FixPropsOVT method -> attempts to fix the props if they are not hidden or shown or if they're in an incorrect location
